# iOS_RBLX
The iOS Roblox repository is the official repository for the iPhone in Roblox project. It contains open-source code for you to use in your app or project for the iPhone. This repository also contains function lines for use if your app(s) need a system function for it to work.

## How does all of this work?
How this will work is by using function lines. You can use these functions in your apps whenever and however you want them to.

## How can I test my own app?
Not to worry, an iPhone that has been modified, **ONLY** for testing purposes. That way, you can still get the same frameworks, applications, and much more, just without the normal applications from a normal iPhone.
